            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Google May Have Found a Way to Make the Real-World Web Work</h1><p>Remember beacons? Honestly, there's not much reason you would. Hailed for years by Apple, Google, and beyond as one of the next big things in tech-for marketers, at least-the glorious beacon future has yet to arrive in the present. They may get a little closer, however, now that Google has solved one of their major issues.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/60f00415e118224ecabc9f288eafe337a9d94455.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Tesla Will Destroy the Automobile Industry</h1><p>If there's an example of a company about to disruptively innovate an entire industry, it's Tesla. Partly, this is because of raw technology--Tesla's is clearly superior to that of its competitors. Partly, it's because Tesla has a more efficient business model. As Slate recently pointed out, Tesla bypasses value-subtracting dealer franchises and universally disliked car salespeople.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/967786c4c9a099ae3d4e342800c9901098d0268b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Light Phone: Designed for Disconnecting</h1><p>Phone addiction is real-as evidenced by a quick glance down the street, in the subway, even at the dinner table-and is one of the reasons why Apple developed a watch: so we would look at our screens less and be present more. For some, however, a smartwatch isn't enough-it still leaves room for fiddling and distraction.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/83d0f5ce299ad3d7f079d449896c88dcc2ec48b8.jpg"></article>]]></description>
